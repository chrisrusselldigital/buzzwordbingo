# Buzzword bingo


## Background

After hearing the same corporate buzzwords, over and over again, I wanted to create something I could share with my work colleagues as a bit of fun but also to hopefully remove some corporate flannel.

I also wanted to demonstrate building a product in an "agile" manner.

## Features

- Submit 6 buzzword
- Display buzzword on page
- Cross buzzwords off one by one
- Once all buzzwords have been crossed off, the game is over

## Approach

I started building the very basic interface. I knew I needed a form to allow a user to enter the buzzword, so that's where I started. I didn't use any other code other than what I absolutely needed to get this to work.
