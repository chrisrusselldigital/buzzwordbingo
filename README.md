# Buzzword bingo


## Background

After hearing the same corporate buzzwords, over and over again, I wanted to create a product I could share with my work colleagues as a bit of fun but also to hopefully remove some corporate flannel.

I also wanted to demonstrate building a product in an "agile" manner.
